# Academy schools breach transparency rules

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBC-Data-Unit/academytransparency/master/academytransparency.png)

Nineteen academy schools are to be investigated for "flouting" rules on transparency following [an investigation by the BBC data unit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37620007) in November 2016.

BBC England's data unit selected 100 academies across England at random and found 19 of them had not either published a current register of interests for governors on their school or trust websites, or had only given the interests of directors and members.

We chose not to publish the names of schools while the DfE looks into the findings. However, we may publish data here once investigations are completed.
